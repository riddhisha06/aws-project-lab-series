## 🚀 What’s Inside?

Explore my journey through AWS, covering five core modules essential to modern cloud computing:

---

### 1. 🖥️ EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud
> **Launch, Host & Scale Virtual Servers**

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) allows users to launch and manage virtual machines in the cloud. In this module, I worked with both Amazon Linux and Windows instances.

**Key Highlights:**
- Launched and configured Linux and Windows servers
- Installed and hosted websites using Apache and IIS
- Created and used custom AMIs for faster deployments
- Attached additional EBS Volumes for persistent storage
- Took and restored Snapshots for backup and disaster recovery
- Set up Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) and Load Balancers (ELB) to ensure high availability

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides scalable and secure object storage. This module focused on storing, accessing, and securing static and dynamic files.

**Key Highlights:**
- Created multiple **S3 Buckets** with specific configurations
- Managed access permissions (public, private, and IAM-based)
- Enabled **Versioning** to track file changes
- Generated **Presigned URLs** for temporary secure file sharing
- Changed **storage classes** (Standard, IA, Glacier) for cost optimization
- Explored **Static Website Hosting** directly from S3
